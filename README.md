### Description

The following criteria was given:

- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

The following link below will deploy to the webpage. Once users open the webpage they are prompted with the rules before starting. Once the users click the start button, a timer will start counting down and a series of questions will prompt. Each answers that are correct a score will be added, but when answered wrong the timer will be deducted by 3s.
